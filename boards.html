            My hobby would definitely be along the lines of video games. I enjoy a ton of very nerdy activities though!
            Games have been a source of entertainment for me for as long as I can remember. 
            Im not picky with what I play and often can enjoy most any genre of game. 
            My favorites would have to be FromSoftware titles like Dark Souls or the new Elden Ring. 
            This also goes for horror games! I adore Silent Hill and Dead Space~
            Lastly i enjoy vr games and use vr as another one of my hobbys.
